<h1>Electronic structure of crystalline polymers</h1>

<h2>Structural notations and conventions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Considered are only 1D-polymers aligned in one direction, with a single bond between monomers.</li>
<li>The coordinate system is oriented in such a way that polymer chains run along X axis
 and the π-system is directed along Z axis.</li>
<li>Each monomer has continuous set of atom indexes,
 and monomers with smaller X-coordinate have smaller indexes.</li>
<li>By default the origin is put at the middle point between the unit cell and its left replica.</li>
<li>Capping atoms (do not belong to monomers) are indexed at the very end of an oligomer
 and are ordered as left end, then right end.</li>
<li>A crystal or a bundle of polymer chains are defined by a list of five parameters per bundle:
 <code>[ξ,y,z,φ,g]</code>, see <a href="PolymBundleParam.svg">figure</a>.
 Here <code>ξ=x/a]</code> is the shift along the polymer in units of the translation period <code>a</code>,
 <code>y,z</code> are displacements in YZ-plane,
 <code>φ</code> is "setting angle" defining polymer rotation around X-axis in the right-hand rule,
 such that <code>φ=0</code> corresponds to the polymer plane perpendicular to Z-axis,
 and <code>g</code> is a combination of X,Y,Z-reflections,
 This parameters are applied in the reverse order:
 the reference polymer <code>[0,0,0,0,1]</code> is transformed by <code>g</code>, then rotated by <code>φ</code>, and then displaced by <code>(ξa,y,z)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Computational methodology</h2>
<p>All calculations and data processing are performed with the same set of computational protocols referenced below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial geometry is generated from the list of <code>[ξ,y,z,φ,g]</code> for the unit cell.
    Initial guess for parameters <code>y,z,φ</code> can be derived from a cross-sectional model of polymer packing,
    whereas a scan is needed to determine optimal values of <code>ξ,g</code>.
    Also, all conformations of a single polymer chain should be considered.
    MD in a small supercell allows to get new structures.
    For two polymer chains per unt cell, the procedure is illustrated for P3HT system in Ref.[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11271">Zhugayevych18</a>].

<h2>Selection of materials</h2>
<p>Datasets are composed and will be refined in future according to the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>All included materials have a well-defined 'main' polymorph known either experimentally (in most of the cases) or obtained by comprehensive computational search.
 Here "well defined" means that different accurate approaches (including experiment) converge to the same structure.</li>
<li>All crystals are dynamically stable except for a few higher energy polymorphs either with small imaginary frequencies or important for some reason (e.g. structural prototypes).
 For crystals with large unit cell vibrational frequencies are not calculated.</li>
<li>Majority of datasets are limited to elements of the first three periods.
 Some datasets involve elements of the 4th period, e.g. transition metals.
 Heavier elements are avoided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Datasets</h2>
<p>All data are 7-zipped into one archive per method (see next Section)
 + <a href="data/exp.7z">experimental data</a>
 + <a href="data/core.7z">core data</a> (the dataset itself).
 Below is more detailed information about each subset including list of systems in each subset as text files whose first line contains coma-separated list of entries.
 See description of notations at the end of this webpage.
 Because for isolated molecules much more complicated calculations can be performed in a basis of atomic orbitals,
 we have added single-molecule calculations below.</p>
