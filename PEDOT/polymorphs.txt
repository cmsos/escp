Notations:
 Code is the list of signs encoding orientation of C2H4 group in XZ-plane for each monomer in unit cell
 There are only four combinations of signs encoded as 'aa','ab','ba','bb'
 High-symmetry polymorphs are labeled with 'H'
 Low-symmetry polymorphs are labeled with 'T' if only tilt is present and 'L' otherwise
 Incompletely relaxed structures are additionally labeled with 'x'

Symmetry:
 Monomer symmetry is 1/2-x,+y,-z (rotation around Y-axis)
 NN-monomers are generated by one of 4 point-symmetry operations {x or 1/2-x},-y,Â±z combined with X- or Z-translations
